    {Jan 2022 - Dec 2023}
    {
          \begin{cvitems}    
        \item {Architected and implemented a full-stack, end-to-end ML pipeline for improved forecast accuracy of Chewy Autoship orders. Combining PySpark for ETL processes via AWS Glue, model training and inference via AWS Sagemaker, and orchestration through Apache Airflow dags, the project not only outperforms the existing heuristic-based model by 3-5\% MAPE, but also provided a scalable framework with automated backtesting and dynamic performance reporting functionality.}    
        \item {Engineered and deployed a cutting-edge Hierarchical Reconciliation framework as a callable API, allowing for seamless integration with existing forecasting systems and providing a robust and scalable solution for reconciling forecasts across multiple granularities. This framework is now used by a majority of our production ML pipelines.}
        % \item {Enhanced the core SKU demand model by integrating promotion features, fine-tuning model accuracy and responsiveness to market trends and promotional impacts.}
        \item {Redesigned unconstrained demand model, which is central to our core SKU demand model. The updated framework includes an ensemble of clickstream heuristic models and self-attention-based transformer models allowing for more accurate and insightful demand forecasting and reducing out-of-stock MAPE by up to 10\%.}
        % \item {Developed a Hierarchical Reconciliation framework to ensure coherency across forecasting granularities, based on latest research and rigorous unit testing.}
        % \item {Led effort into topic demand forecasting, employing a temporal knowledge graph approach to capture seasonal and thematic trends effectively.}

    {Machine Learning Engineer III - Supply Chain Forecasting}
    {Dec 2023 - Present}
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        % \item {Revamped Load Forecasting systems for over 30 clients reducing MAPE by 4-10\%, implementing an ensembling approach using models like RNN/CNN and XGBoost with k-fold cross-validation and outlier detection.}
        \item {In my expanded role, I've spearheaded the enhancement of many of our production pipelines, taking a proactive approach to improve our team's flagship products through meticulous testing and scalability improvements.}
        \item {Led effort into topic demand forecasting, employing a temporal knowledge graph approach to capture both seasonal and thematic trends effectively.}
        \item {Led effort into customer behavior analytics, leverage big data technologies like Spark and Hadoop to draw conclusions from our massive user clickstream dataset that aid in our model development.}
