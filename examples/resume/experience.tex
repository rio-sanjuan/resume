%           \begin{cvitems}    
%         \item {Architected and implemented an end-to-end ML pipeline for Chewy Autoship orders. Combining PySpark for ETL processes via AWS Glue, model training and inference via AWS Sagemaker, and orchestration through Apache Airflow dags, the project outperforms the existing heuristic-based model by 3-5\% MAPE, but also works as a scalable framework for future e2e ML tasks.}    
%         \item {Engineered and deployed a Hierarchical Reconciliation framework as a callable API, allowing for seamless integration with existing systems for reconciling forecasts across multiple granularities. This framework is now used by a majority of our production ML pipelines.}
%         % \item {Enhanced the core SKU demand model by integrating promotion features, fine-tuning model accuracy and responsiveness to market trends and promotional impacts.}
%         \item {Redesigned unconstrained demand model, which is central to our core SKU demand model. The updated framework includes an ensemble of clickstream heuristic models and self-attention-based transformer models allowing for more accurate and insightful demand forecasting and reducing out-of-stock MAPE by up to 10\%.}
%         % \item {Developed a Hierarchical Reconciliation framework to ensure coherency across forecasting granularities, based on latest research and rigorous unit testing.}
%         % \item {Led effort into topic demand forecasting, employing a temporal knowledge graph approach to capture seasonal and thematic trends effectively.}

This framework is now used by a majority of our production ML pipelines.}        
        \item {Designed and deployed a forecast evaluation framework, allowing for automated comparison of forecast performance across our product catalogue, enabling us to rank model variants for specific use-cases like holiday planning, short-range labor planning, and long-lead buying decisions.}
        \item {Led multiple white-paper reviews within the team covering the latest research in both the field of Data Science and the eCommerce/operation planning space.}
        % \item {Worked with our Staff MLE to design and deploy an end-to-end ML pipeline for forecasting aggregate-level series. The pipeline involves the orchestration of both shared and model-specific pre-processing, tuning, and inference. Personally deployed 7 distinct model variants (e.g. XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) that consistently represented in the top 3 performing models presented to leadership during our weekly demand reviews.}
